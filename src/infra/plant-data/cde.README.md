# Cemento del Este

Plant CDE uses two kinds of fuel: coal and RDF.

RDF is "refuse derived fuel": household waste that's been ground up into little bits. It's surprisingly energy dense, because a lot of it is plastic.

Cement plants burn the clothes you buy from Shein, and the kitchen gadgets you buy from Amazon. This is the environmentally friendly option, believe it or not. They also burn olive stones,
sewage sludge, kerosene, hydrogen, and anything else they can get their hands on.
The variability caused by cement plants burning random stuff is a major driver for the use
of AI in process control.

CDE burns as much RDF as they can, because they get paid to burn it. The dosing equipment that they have can burn up to 120 tons an hour. Because it's rubbish, the NCV is variable. In order to get the kiln hot enough, the plant also burns coal.

The amount of coal that the plant burns varies with the NCV of the RDF - lower quality rubbish -> more coal.

Sometimes the plant can't get any RDF, and they have to burn 100% coal. This is bad for their profits, and the planet.
