# DEF (Dynamic Eco Formworks)

DEF don't burn coal at all. Instead they burn petcoke, which is the hard matter left over from oil refining. It's extremely high density at ~ 7500 kcal/kg.

They use petcoke to balance their RDF.

They measure the NCV of their RDF in Gigajoules/Ton, but their petcoke is still in kcal/kg. Why do they do that? Friend, if you get hired, you'll ask yourself why cement plants do _anything_.
